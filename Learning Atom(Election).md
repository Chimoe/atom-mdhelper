# Learning Atom(Election)

In the beginning of our project, I focused mainly on studying the Electron framework and basic Atom handling.

A basic Electron package contains three files: package.json, main.js and index.html, which corresponds to data, code and interface. The main part of the project lies heavily on main.js, but I also studied JSON due to other ongoing RCOS project requirements.

I also read the Atom Flight Manual to learn its basic handling and APIs. This may take some time as I'm new to Atom.

My next post could be the notes when I'm creating a Markdown cheatsheet.
