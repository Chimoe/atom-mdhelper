# Creating Markdown cheatsheet

Before creating any code for my Atom package, I made a complete guide for
Markdown as a reference to possible package features.

This reference contains two parts, one for general Markdown grammars and the
other one for GitHub Flavored Markdown grammars. During the creation of this
guide, I learnt multiple Markdown cheats and it served as a great reference.
